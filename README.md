# # Project Name

## Overview

This project is a collection of C programs that [briefly describe the overall purpose of your project, e.g., "implement various algorithms," "provide tools for data processing," etc.]. Each C file in this repository serves a specific purpose, and together, they showcase [what the project demonstrates or achieves].

## Project Structure

Below is a breakdown of each C file in this repository and its purpose:

- **`file1.c`**: [Provide a brief description of what this file does, e.g., "Contains the implementation of a binary search algorithm."]
- **`file2.c`**: [Provide a brief description of what this file does, e.g., "Handles input parsing and validation."]
- **`file3.c`**: [Provide a brief description of what this file does, e.g., "Implements the main program logic and ties all components together."]
- **`file4.c`**: [Provide a brief description of what this file does, e.g., "Provides utility functions for mathematical operations."]
- **`file5.c`**: [Provide a brief description of what this file does, e.g., "Contains unit tests for the functions in `file1.c` and `file4.c`."]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- [Any other dependencies or tools needed, e.g., "Make sure `make` is installed if using the Makefile."]

### Building the Project

To compile all the C files and create an executable, run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o my_program file1.c file2.c file3.c file4.c file5.c
